=head1 NAME

Chronicle::Plugin::Snippets::Archives - Generate archives.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will be invoked automatically when your site is built
via the C<on_generate> hook which Chronicle provides.

It is responsible for creating the a data-structure to show archived
posts which is a nested loop of:

=for example begin

    year1/
      month1 - count
      month2 - count
      ..
    year2/
      month1 - count
      month2 - count
      ..

=for example end

Whether you choose to use this in your templates is up to you.

Like most of these global-data the output will look reasonable, and be fast,
for a small number of posts, but quickly become slow and crowded with a large
history.

This plugin must be called "early".

This means we're called prior to any of the page-generation plugins, such
that any page-templates which make use of the data-structure we've created
are called after that structure is setup.
